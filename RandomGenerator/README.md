# Random Generator
This module all aspects relative to random number generation.

It work on number generation using **Internal** or **External** sources


## Internal sources
Internal sources are random source dependent by the architecture in which program run.
For example */dev/urandom* or the classical random sequences.


## External sources
External sources are random source dependent by the external devices.
For example a quantum computer, a particular hardware device, etc...
